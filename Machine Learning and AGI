for simple regression there are many function spaces, but as the complexity grows , there will be infinitely,
so what prior or inductive bias we have to include there such that we can effeciently find function for our models.
or it can generalise well beyond training data , Neural networks can do this(to some extent in their manifold), but there have to be some sort of abstraction.
